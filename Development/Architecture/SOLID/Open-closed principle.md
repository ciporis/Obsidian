The code should be opened for extention and closed for modification. We can add something to method or class but can't edit it.

Behaviour is controlled by interface.
We can use method, which recieves other method as an argument

We can use one main method, which recieves list or methods and an order. We just use every method from the list on order and return the result.

Also we can use template method, which contains some predefined methods and we cannot change them. But there are our custom methods, which can be changed.
