SRP entities should have obly one reason to change (it means if different developers want to change the class with absolutely different reasons this class is bad)

One component - one task
One component - one responsibility
One component - one usage scenario 

If it's difficult to answer (or it's too long answer) "What does this class or function do?" we should change something.
We shouldn't make a new class for every new small task, there is a limit of splitting.

Function's name says what function does.
