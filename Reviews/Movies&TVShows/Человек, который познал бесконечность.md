It was recommended by me Geometry and Topology teacher - Alsu Rafaelevna (Алсу Рафаэльевна)
This movie is about an Indian person who made many mathematical discoveries and decided to show them to the world.
It's not really mathematically strong, creators decided to make the movie more "user friendly". But it's not bad anyway. 
I watched pretty interesting and tragical story. After watching I charged to make something own and leave something in the Human History
